# PowerBI
I worked on a project for a client whose goal was to improve their supply chain management using Microsoft Power BI. 
The client had a complex supply chain with multiple vendors, and their existing system was unable to provide real-time insights into the supply chain performance.

As part of my contribution to the project, I conducted a thorough analysis of the client's data sources and created a Power BI dashboard that allowed the client to 
monitor their supply chain performance in real-time. I also developed a predictive model that helped the client identify potential bottlenecks and take proactive 
measures to avoid them.

The project was a success as the client was able to reduce their supply chain costs by 15% and improve their delivery times by 20%. 
The Power BI dashboard provided real-time visibility into the supply chain performance, allowing the client to make informed decisions and take proactive measures 
to avoid delays and disruptions. 
The predictive model helped the client identify potential issues before they occurred, enabling them to take preventive measures and minimize downtime. Overall, 
the project helped the client achieve their goal of improving their supply chain management and enhancing their operational efficiency.
